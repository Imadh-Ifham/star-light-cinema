# 🎬 Movie Booking System (PHP + MySQL)

This is a simple **Movie Booking System** developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **PHP**, and **MySQL** with **raw SQL queries**.  
It was one of my early full-stack projects completed as a **1st-year assignment at SLIIT**.

The system mainly focuses on implementing full **CRUD functionality** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) across all core modules.
